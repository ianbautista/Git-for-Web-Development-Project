        Then the Project repo will then be submitted in to the student's created branch.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        An inline element doesn't cover the entire width of the page while a block covers the entire width of the page hence always starting on a new line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        When an element is positioned absolutely it is placed in an exact location on the page.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        use the display property and assign a value of inline-block. 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Block Elements:
            a. <p>
            b. <div>
            c. <nav>
        Inline Elements:
            a. <span> 
            b. <a>
        Inline-Block Element:
            a. <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model is the way how elements are modeled in a webpage. The box model consist of four properties. The content, padding, border, and the margin.
        If we use a house analogy. and look at the house from a bird's eye view. We can think of the content as the house, the padding as the lawn that surrounds your house and is in between your house (content) and your fence (border).
        Border is the fence and margin as the field that surrounds your property.
        A fix is to use the property box-sizing with the value border-box. This will contain the width to whatever you set it to.
